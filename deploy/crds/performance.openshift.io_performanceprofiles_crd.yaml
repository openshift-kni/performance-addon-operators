                  description: BalanceIsolated toggles whether or not the Isolated
                    CPU set is eligible for load balancing work loads. When this option
                    is set to "false", the Isolated CPU set will be static, meaning
                    workloads have to explicitly assign each thread to a specific
                    cpu in order to work across multiple CPUs. Setting this to "true"
                    allows workloads to be balanced across CPUs. Setting this to "false"
                    offers the most predictable performance for guaranteed workloads,
                    but it offloads the complexity of cpu load balancing to the application.
